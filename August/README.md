### Literate Programs

> The **literate programming** metalanguage provides **two important features**. **The first is the ability to mix prose with source code.** This feature makes the description of the program just as important as its actual source code, encouraging careful design and documentation. **Second, the language provides mechanisms for presenting the program code to the reader in an order that is entirely different from the compiler input.** Thus, the program can be described in a logical manner. Each named block of code is called a fragment, and each fragment can refer to other fragments by name.
